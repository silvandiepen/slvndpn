			<h2>Henri's</h2>

			<h3>
				Henri’s is a simple to install Sass toolbelt which gives you the freedom and joy of building things yourself, with a
				set of handy tools to speed it up.
			</h3>

			<div class="content-row row">
				<div class="column small-full medium-third">
					<h4>But what does it actually do?</h4>
					<p>
						Well a lot, it gives you a shitload of functions, mixins and other tools, to speed up your styling. But also keeps
						it fun to actually style the things you want. It doesn’t have any out put by default, so its very lightweight, but
						give you full control over what to output and how much. So the default is 0kb.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="column small-full medium-third">
					<h4>Work with everything because it doesn’t do stuff you don’t need.</h4>
					<p>
						Wow, that sounds vague! But it’s not. Many Sass frameworks give you also a lot of javascript to make stuff work.
						Henri’s doesn’t. Which makes it possible to use Henri’s in every kind of project. The only dependency is Sass.
						Either Node Sass, Sass or Ruby Sass. It doesn’t have any out put by default, so its very lightweight, but give you
						full control over what to output and how much. So the default is 0kb.
