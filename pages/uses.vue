				So, I find it really interesting to see what other people use, and why

			<h2>Hardware</h2>
			<h4>
				At home and at work I have a similar setup and some things are of course
				going with me back and forwards.
			</h4>
			<Row>
				<Item title="Computers">
					A 13‚Ä≥ <strong>Macbook Pro</strong> (2019) with 16gb. The 13‚Ä≥ is
					perfectly portable since I have to carry it around all day long. Also
					I work with bigger screens, I actually had the choice, but I still
					went for the 13‚Äù. The Oldy; a 21‚Ä≥ <strong>iMac</strong> from 2010.
					This computer has travelled with me to many locations and did function
					for a long time. At the moment its just my data center and used for an
					occasional browse.
				</Item>
				<Item title="Phone">
					An <strong>iPhone XS</strong> which I usually trade in every two
					years. Coming from Blackberries which I really liked and was
					hesitating to trade in until Blackberry really was dead, I‚Äôm not caged
					in by Apple, but I don‚Äôt mind.
				</Item>
				<Item title="Monitor">
					The <strong>LG 27UK670</strong>, I would love to have a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù
					monitor, actually just a old cinema display with USB-C and 4K display
					would be perfect, but that doesn‚Äôt exist.
				</Item>
				<Item title="Mouse & Keyboard">
					Just Apple all the way. As well as on my current work as at home I use
					a black <strong>Magic Keyboard </strong> and
					<strong>Magic Trackpad</strong>.
				</Item>
				<Item title="Data">
					A series of little orange <strong>Lacie Rugged</strong> disks. I
					unfortunately cant really use them with my Macbook Pro anymore, but
					they are still really nice and sustainable drives.
				</Item>
				<Item title="Tablet">
					An old and crappy <strong>iPad Air</strong> which still works and
					usually only comes with me in the airplane. I can‚Äôt use the headphone
					jack so use it with my headphones and the little extender which I need
					for my phone anyway. It could have been nice actually, but one day.. I
					decided to fix the (broken) screen myself. That wasn't a success.
					Since then the headphone jack is wack and the home buttons doesnt work
					anymore. A iPad pro is very high on my wishlist.. but yeah...
				</Item>
				<Item title="Drawing">
					My Wacom! At work I still have the older
					<strong>wacom Intuos 3 A4</strong>. And didn't buy a new one because I
					don't have the money for it (which is also true), but mainly because
					the old just works. I have experience with the new models, but in some
					way they always end up not working.
				</Item>
				<Item title="Camera">
					Most pictures nowadays I take just using my iPhone. Why? Because I‚Äôm
					too lazy to carry my camera bag around. Although I really should do
					that more. My camera bag a Crumpler which my wife calles ‚Äúthe Turtle‚Äù
					includes a
					<strong>Canon 6D</strong>, a Canon 60D and a few lenses; Canon 50mm
					F2.8, Canon EF 17-40mm F4 and a Canon EF 70-200mm F4

			<h2>Editor & Terminal</h2>
			<h4>
				Editors and terminals are changing a lot, at the moment I‚Äôm using VSCode
				and iTerm, but this might change any moment. I have tried many other
				editors, but keep coming back. Here‚Äôs how it evolved‚Ä¶
			</h4>
			<Row>
				<Item title="Visual Studio Code">
					Through the years I‚Äôve used many code editors, started coding in plain
					Notepad, went to Dreamweaver, back to Notepad because it was lighter,
					Notepad++ because it gave me highlighting and later I got a Mac, back
					to Texteditor. Eventually that didn‚Äôt make sense and I needed an
					‚Äúactual‚Äù editor so I started using Coda. Which I actually till the day
					of today still use for opening single code files or even edit my
					invoices in. From Coda I went to Atom, which has been my code editor
					for a long time, but recently, like a year ago I moved on. Left Atom
					where it is and moved to VS Code, it was a pain in the ass in the
					beginning, but I can‚Äôt go back anymore!
				</Item>
				<Item title="iTerm">
					What can I say? Since the day it came out, I‚Äôve been using iTerm and
					never went away from it. I install my own colorschemes and just go
					with it. I have tried some other editors in the meanwhile but keep
					coming back.
